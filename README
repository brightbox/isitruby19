== Is it ruby 1.9?

An application that grabs a list of gems (from Rubyforge) and lets people comment on whether they work or not.  

=== Rake tasks

Set up the list of default platforms: 

  rake isitruby19:load_platforms
  
Import the list of gems from Rubyforge:

  rake isitruby19:import
  
Clear out the sessions table (we are using ActiveRecord sessions to keep stuff on our server, not on the client machine): 

  rake isitruby19:clear_expired_sessions
